###by team us
-Joseph Darwood, Shreyas Jagular, Bradley Cruz, Abdelaziz Hammad

##1-Introduction
Me and my group are motivated to make this game because of our passion for gaming. We wish to channel our passion for video games and software engineering and coding into this project. We hope to display a variety of skills aswell as learn a variety of new ones over the course of this project.

##2-Background and Related Work
We intend to impliment a game vaguely based off of rougelikes/rougelites such as deadcells, hades, and other such games. We intend to build from the game engine up using c++ with a ECS architecture. Over the course of building this project we will likely need to learn more about ECS design architecture, graphics rendering and optimization, testing, and various other topics.
